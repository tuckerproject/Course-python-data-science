The higher rates are due, in large part, to the fact that passengers were treated differently by the crew and given first access to the lifeboats. It does not account for whether female passengers were more likely to survive, all other things being equal. Can a causal analysis provide a more nuanced perspective on the data? Apply the `dowhy` learner to the data, using “Sex” as the treatment and “Survived” as the outcome. Look at the average treatment effect and the causal estimate.
